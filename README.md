# Sales Forecasting with XGBoost Model

This project aims to forecast sales using the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) machine learning algorithm. Sales forecasting is a crucial task for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and overall strategy. By leveraging machine learning techniques like XGBoost, we can create accurate forecasts that help optimize business operations and improve profitability.

## Introduction

Sales forecasting involves predicting future sales based on historical data and other relevant factors such as seasonality, promotions, and economic trends. In this project, we utilize the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique known for its performance in structured/tabular data.



## Usage

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Prepare your sales data (see [Data](#data)).
2. Train the XGBoost model (see [Model Training](#model-training)).
3. Evaluate the model's performance (see [Evaluation](#evaluation)).

Feel free to customize the scripts according to your specific requirements and data characteristics.

## Data

The success of the sales forecasting model heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the input data. Ensure that your dataset includes:

- Historical sales data
- Timestamps (e.g., date or time periods)
- Relevant features (e.g., promotional activities, holidays, economic indicators)
