# Sales Forecasting with XGBoost Model

This project aims to forecast sales using the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) machine learning algorithm. Sales forecasting is a crucial task for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and overall strategy. By leveraging machine learning techniques like XGBoost, we can create accurate forecasts that help optimize business operations and improve profitability.

## Introduction

Sales forecasting involves predicting future sales based on historical data and other relevant factors such as seasonality, promotions, and economic trends. In this project, we utilize the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique known for its performance in structured/tabular data.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-forecasting-xgboost.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Prepare your sales data (see [Data](#data)).
2. Train the XGBoost model (see [Model Training](#model-training)).
3. Evaluate the model's performance (see [Evaluation](#evaluation)).

Feel free to customize the scripts according to your specific requirements and data characteristics.

## Data

The success of the sales forecasting model heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the input data. Ensure that your dataset includes:

- Historical sales data
- Timestamps (e.g., date or time periods)
- Relevant features (e.g., promotional activities, holidays, economic indicators)

Example datasets can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training

To train the XGBoost model, run the `train_model.py` script:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_path data/train_data.csv --model_output_path models/sales_forecast_model.pkl
```

Adjust the paths and parameters as needed based on your data and requirements.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Use the `evaluate_model.py` script:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --data_path data/test_data.csv --model_path models/sales_forecast_model.pkl
```

Again, adapt the paths and parameters according to your setup.
